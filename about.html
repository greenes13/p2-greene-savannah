						<button class="accordion">Community</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  <p>The Krewe of Muses is an organization of women committed to improving our community through effective action. Together, we have helped reconstruct homes after tragedy, worked with community partners to create spectacular decorations for our parade, and raised thousands for causes we care about deeply. Our projects change year-to-year, though our focus is always on our community, particularly organizations that provide services to women and children.</p>

						<button class="accordion">Mythology</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  <p>In Greek mythology, the Muses are the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. Sometimes these ethereal goddess are referred to as water nymphs, as they were born from the four sacred springs that flowed on Helicon after Pegasus, the winged horse, stamped his hooves on the ground. They are known for their divine beauty, grace, and allure; they arouse the inspiration necessary for creation in artists, especially poets, dancers, musicians, and philosophers. Their favorites were bestowed with the noblest thoughts, the sweetest harmonies, eloquence, wisdom, knowledge, and understanding.</p>
						</div>

						<button class="accordion">Honorary Muses</button>
						<div class="panel">
						  <p>Every year, the Krewe of Muses honors one distinguished woman with New Orleans connections who embodies the spirit of Muses. The Honorary Muse earns a coveted position in a 17-foot tall, fiber optic, red high-heel shoe at the beginning of our parade. These women have distinguished careers and inspire New Orleans women and future Muses, and we are honored to have celebrated Muses Thersday with these goddesses.
